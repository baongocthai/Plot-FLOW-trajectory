# Plot-FLOW-trajectory

# =============================================================================
# This script plots the trajectory of water from the specified origin (location & vertical layer)
# up to the estimated distance based on specified duration and velocity (m/s)
# This is to estimate the horizontal mixing length at a point of observation
# From D3D-FLOW result, export horizontal velocity at all layer at a specified location as .csv file using QUICKPLOT
# From D3D-FLOW result, export depth average at all layer at a specified location as .csv file using QUICKPLOT
# Change the location & vertical_layer in Main block
